<h1>My Interests and Activities<h1> 

<p> During my free time I often like to do activities and such that interest me. Hockey is
one of my biggest hobbies, I love playing the game and watching it. This year at UMaine, I 
was luck enough to earn a spot on the club hockey team. I also like to participate in other
sports such as baseball and disc golf. My other major interest besides sports is the outdoors.
I love to go hiking or being on the water in a kayak, whether with my friends or by myself 
enjoying the peace. I did this often during the summer at my lake house and hope to continue
the outdoor fun with landmarks such as Acadia National Park and Stillwater River. </p>

	<h1>My History</h1>
	
	<p> I was born on August 6th 1999 and have lived in Franklin, Massachussetts since
	birth. I live with my three siblings, Matthew, Meghan, and Kathleen and my two parents
	John and Lisa. Growing up I was extremely shy and would only share myself to those I 
	felt comfortable around until I broke out of my shell in sixth grade, where I met my
	my best friends to this day. Not during the school year, ever since I could remember 
	I would spend my summers in	a small cottage in Morgan, Vermont on Lake Seymour. I chose 
	to attend Franklin High School and graduated in June of 2017. During highschool I 
	participated in clubs, sports,	and work outside of school. I then made one of the 
	biggest decisions of my life to date and chose to attend the University of Maine over 
	my other accepted schools, bringing us	to present day. </p>

<h1>The Future Ahead of me<h1>

<p> I am currently attending school while studying business management and international fairs.
 I am also enrolled in the NROTC program as a Marine Corps option.<p>
 
 <pre> This brings me too two parts in my future:
 	
 		- Military future
 		
 		- Business future
 <pre>
<h2><b>My Military Future</b></h2>

<p> After I graduate from the University of Maine my senior year, I will take my oath and
be commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps. As a entry level
commissioned officer I will be inexperienced and mentored by those senior to me. With the 
commission, I will now be in charge of a platoon, ranging anywhere from sixteen to forty
four marines. My service will be a duration of four to five years in active duty and then 
I will hopefully embark on a successful business career. <p>

<h3>My Business Future</h3>

<p> Upon my retirement or joining the reserves of the United States Marine Corps, I will
explore my options in the fields of business (my major) or international affairs (my minor).
If I decide to lean towards my minor in international affairs there is a strong chance that
government work would be open for me due to my education combined with military experience. 
My other option would be to explore the business world with my degree. One option that I
have viewed and am interested in is a position as a star agent, which my degree would
qualify me for.<p>
